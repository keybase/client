**Attention, please.**

This code is a work in progress, and we publish it for full transparency. You can review the source code, but:

 - you shouldn't just run this code without reading it, as it may have bugs or stubbed out crypto
 - it might not do exactly what it says it is doing

If you really want to install Keybase, please return to the repo [README.md](https://github.com/keybase/client/blob/master/README.md) for official release instructions.

----------

## Keybase (Electron)

This directory is an exploration of using react-native alongside React in Electron.

It's an early prototype, not ready for use yet.

To run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Available npm run commands:

 - `npm start`: Build a development bundle and start the app off of those files (If you're running the app once)
 - `hot-server`: Start the hot-reloading server
 - `start-hot`: Connect to a hot-reloading server (If you're developing and want to see changes as you make them)
 - `build-dev`: Build a development bundle
 - `build-prod`: Build a production bundle
 - `start-cold`: Start the app off of the build-dev bundles
 - `package`: Make an electron application build

Environment variables:

 - `HOME`: Home dir to use, useful for multiple installs
 - `KEYBASE_RUN_MODE`: production, staging, devel
 - `KEYBASE_LOCAL_DEBUG` (bool): Debug
 - `KEYBASE_SHOW_DEVTOOLS` (bool): Show devtools
 - `KEYBASE_FEATURES`: Feature flags
 - `KEYBASE_RPC_DELAY`: Number of ms to delay all RPC calls (requires debug mode)
 - `KEYBASE_RPC_DELAY_RESULT`: Number of ms to delay all RPC call callbacks (requires debug mode)


### Sourcemaps

Getting sourcemaps to work in the production app:

Download the matching sourcemaps from the build folder. Run the following npm command, passing the path to the unzipped path

```
npm run inject-sourcemaps-prod -- /mysourcemaps/Keybase-1.0.7-20160111080008+1049d47.map
```

This will copy the sourcemaps into the application package (if installed in the default location). Otherwise you can just do this yourself

If you have a crash of a non-sourcemapped build (like a screenshot with a crash) you can do a post-mortem debug of the minimized code by using a utility.

```
npm install -g sourcemap-finder
smfinder --position 1200:10 path-to-your-source-map
```

### Dependencies

Updating packages

Some of these steps are theoretically not needed but in practice npm is buggy as hell. Make sure your npm is updated globally
```npm install -g npm```

1. Remove old shrinkwrap: Run ```rm npm-shrinkwrap.json```
2. Find outdated packages: Run ```npm outdated```
3. Install updated packages: Run ```npm install -E -S packageName@specificVersion``` or ```npm install -E -D devPackageName@specificVersion```
4. If in react-native, delete our dummy net package. ```rm -rf node_modules/net```
5. Build shrinkwrap: Run ```npm shrinkwrap --dev```
