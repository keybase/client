Policy change on passphrases

We've gotten lots of feedback that it's annoying as all hell to enter a
Keybase passphrase after restarts and updates. The consensus is you can
trust a device's storage to keep a secret that's specific to that device.
Passphrases stink, like passed gas, and are bloody painful, like passed stones.

Note, however: on this device you have a PGP private key in Keybase's local
keychain.  Some people want to type a passphrase to unlock their PGP key, and
this new policy would bypass that. If you're such a person, you can run the
following command to remove your PGP private key.

    keybase pgp purge

If you do it, you'll have to use GPG for your PGP operations.

If you're ok with the new policy, you can run this command so you won't
get bothered with this message in the future:

    keybase dismiss pgp-storage

Thanks!`
