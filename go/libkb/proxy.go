/*

Proxy support is implemented using golang's http library's built in support for proxies. This supports http connect
based proxies and socks5 proxies. Proxies can be configured using: CLI flags, config.json, or environment variables.
See `keybase help advanced` for information on using CLI flags. To configure a proxy using config.json run:

``` bash
keybase config set proxy-type <"socks" or "http_connect">
keybase config set proxy <"localhost:8080" or "username:password@localhost:8080">
```

To configure a proxy using environment variables run:

``` bash
export PROXY_TYPE=<"socks" or "http_connect">
export PROXY=<"localhost:8080" or "username:password@localhost:8080">
```

Internally, we support proxies by setting the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables which
http.ProxyFromEnvironment automatically reads from. Note that http.ProxyFromEnvironment does support
socks5 proxies and basic auth.

By default, the client reaches out to api-0.core.keybaseapi.com which has a self-signed certificate. This
is actually more secure than relying on the standard CA system since we pin the client to only accept this
certificate. By pinning this certificate, we make it so that any proxies that MITM TLS cannot intercept the
client's traffic since even though their certificate is "trusted" according to the CA system, it isn't
trusted by the client. In order to disable SSL pinning and allow TLS MITMing proxies to function, it is
possible to switch the client to trust the public CA system. This can be done in one of three ways:

``` bash
keybase config set disable-ssl-pinning true
# OR
export DISABLE_SSL_PINNING="true"
# OR
keybase --disable-ssl-pinning
```

Note that enabling this option is NOT recommended. Enabling this option allows the proxy to view all traffic between
the client and the Keybase servers.
