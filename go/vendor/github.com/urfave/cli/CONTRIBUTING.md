## Contributing

**NOTE**: the primary maintainer(s) may be found in
[./MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).

Feel free to put up a pull request to fix a bug or maybe add a feature. I will
give it a code review and make sure that it does not break backwards
compatibility. If I or any other collaborators agree that it is in line with
the vision of the project, we will work with you to get the code into
a mergeable state and merge it into the master branch.

If you have contributed something significant to the project, we will most
likely add you as a collaborator. As a collaborator you are given the ability
to merge others pull requests. It is very important that new code does not
break existing code, so be careful about what code you do choose to merge.

If you feel like you have contributed to the project but have not yet been added
as a collaborator, we probably forgot to add you :sweat_smile:.  Please open an
issue!
