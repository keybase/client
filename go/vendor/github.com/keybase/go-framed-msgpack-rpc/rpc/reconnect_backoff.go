// fireOnce is a construct to synchronize different goroutines. Specifically,
// one routine can use wait() to wait on a signal, and another routine can call
// fire() to wake up the first routine. Only the first call to fire() is
// effective, and multiple calls to fire() don't panic.
//
// A zero value fireOnce is valid, and no-op for both fire() and wait(). Use
// newFireOnce() to make one that's fire-able.
//
// This is to replace the use case where a channel may be used to synchronize
// different goroutines, and one routine waits on a channel read while another
// closes the channel to signal the first routine. fireOnce addresses the issue
// where second call to close the channel can panic.
