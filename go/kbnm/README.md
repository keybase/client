# kbnm - Keybase Native Messaging

kbnm is a small shim for bridging communication between the Keybase daemon and
browser extensions.

## Develop

**Warning**: Any changes to kbnm will likely break the browser extension that
depends on it. Make sure that changes are backwards compatible and that there is
an upgrade path.
