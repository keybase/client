## Keybase [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keybase/client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keybase/client) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/90mxorxtj6vixnum/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/keybase/client-x5qrt/branch/master)

Hi, and welcome to the Keybase client repo.  All our client apps (macOS,
Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android) are being actively developed in this
repository. Please, dig around.

### Warnings

We'd love you to read our source code.

But - some of the things in this repo are explorations, and the app you build
from source just *might not do what it says it's doing*. So, if you just want
to install Keybase on your computer, you should **[monitor our releases](https://keybase.io/download)** for macOS, Linux, or Windows.

### Code Layout

* **go**: Core crypto libraries; the Keybase service; the command line client. [Learn More](go/README.md)
* **shared/{android,ios}**: Android and iOS apps developed with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
* **shared/desktop**: Desktop application for macOS, Linux, and Windows, made with the [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) framework, sharing React code with react-native.
* **packaging**: Scripts for releasing packages across the various platforms.
* **protocol**: Defines the protocol for communication for clients to the Keybase services. Uses [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/). [Learn More](protocol/README.md)
* **media**: Icons, graphics, media for Keybase apps.
* **osx**: The macOS Keybase.app, development parallel to an Electron-based application above. [Learn More](osx/README.md)

### Problems?

Report any issues with client software on this GitHub
[issue tracker](https://github.com/keybase/client/issues).
Internally, we track our progress using Jira, but all PRs come through GitHub
for your review!

If you're having problems with the command line `keybase` client, take a
look at [the troubleshooting doc](go/doc/troubleshooting.md).

If you're having problems with our Website, try the
[keybase-issues](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues) issue tracker.

We check and update both frequently.

### License

Most code is released under the New BSD (3 Clause) License.  If subdirectories
include a different license, that license applies instead.

### Development Guidelines

We check all git commits with pre-commit hooks generated via
[pre-commit.com](http://pre-commit.com) pre-commit hooks.
To enable use of these pre-commit hooks:

* [Install](http://pre-commit.com/#install) the `pre-commit` utility. For some common cases:
  * `pip install pre-commit`
  * `brew install pre-commit`
* Remove any existing pre-commit hooks via `rm .git/hooks/pre-commit`
* Configure via `pre-commit install`

Then proceed as normal.

#### External Contributors

If you forked this repository on GitHub and made a PR, then it'll show up as
having failed Jenkins CI. We do not build external PRs because it's a security
risk to do so without a review first. If your PR is successfully reviewed by a
member of the Keybase team, then we will merge your commits to a branch on our
primary fork and build from there.

cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this
distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC
