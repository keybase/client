/**
 * Server abstraction for incoming RPC's
 *
 * The service will make call to us, and we'll want to be able to handle them.
 * Here is the general dance:
 *
 * +---------------------------------------------+
 * | Key:                                        |
 * |  <- : incoming rpc                          |
 * |    ->: reply to incoming rpc (note indent)  |
 * +---------------------------------------------+
 *
 *
 * <- Some `start` message telling us to start a session
 *    -> reply with the our session id for the session
 * ...
 * <-     various messages going back in forth (i.e. updates on tracking status)
 *    ->  reply back
 * ...
 *
 * <- Some `end` message telling us the service is done with this session
 *    -> reply to acknowledge
 *
 *
 * ## The Server Abstraction
 * This class provides an abstraction to the rpc messaging system above.
 *
 *
 * You specify what the start and end message is.
 * You specify a function that returns a map of functions (aka endpoints) to be called during the session
 *
 * 1. The server will create the session when it gets the `start` message, and call your endpointMapFn function
 * with the params it got from the service from the `start` message
 *
 * 2. It will map incoming calls during the session to functions defined in the endpointMapFn
 *
 * 3. When it receives the `end` message it will clean up the session call map.
 *
