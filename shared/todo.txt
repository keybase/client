Some short term todos:
swipeable2 slow
remove F1 debug in chat

text selection delete issues
mem leak
f6 for just a router remount?

framepack, dispatch invocations

show heic preview in get-titles (works)
(preexisting) when forwarding an existing .heic (pre conversion changes) a broken image is shown
also todo, check kbfs heic conversion, currently itâ€™s commented out entirely
