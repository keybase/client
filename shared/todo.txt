Some short term todos:
swipeable2 slow
remove F1 debug in chat


missing author:

how it works:
We render items in between in the list view
They're passed the leading/trailing index
They decide if they need to render anything based on the message and previous (author, time, type, etc)


causes:
Something wrong with store. Seems not the case w/ the current logs.
Separators not being placed?
Hooks not working correctly?
Wrong memoization?
Heights wrong? (you'd see the left side no matter what)
Index / ordinal confusion
