# Boost for React Native

This is a copy of [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) that is used to build React Native (Android) from source. It includes just the Boost source code (without the docs, for example) so that downloading and extracting the files doesn't take too long.

You probably don't want to directly use this repository. Its sole purpose is to distribute the Boost code for building React Native.

## To update

React Native build tools expect specific folder structure.
Run this command to get a .tar.gz file and upload it to Releases.

```
tar -cvzf boost_1_57_0.tar.gz boost_1_57_0/
```


## License
