 * Overlay is the generic form of

 *  - Mobile: sheet appearing at bottom of the screen
 * Both have handlers to hide themselves when the user presses
 * outside of the bounding box. They also include basic styling
 * of the overlay e.g. filling container absolutely and a translucent
 * bg color on native. The desktop styling includes rounded corners and
 * box-shadow. It can also be extended in the future to include a hide
 * / show animation.
