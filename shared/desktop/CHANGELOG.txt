- Folders view! You can browse your public and private folders and see new sharing requests inside the app.

- Search from the app! Want to share data in KBFS with a Twitter user? Just click the Twitter bird and type their username. This will popup a folder for you, and if they're not on Keybase yet, and invitation code to share.

- Support for macOS 10.12 (Sierra).

- Introducing the main GUI screen. This is where you'll look people up, manage your folders, and perform other actions. A lot of the features are stubbed out, but you can start playing with it.

- Sharing before signup! Go ahead and put data in /keybase/private/you,friend@twitter/. If you have any invite codes, this will pop up a window with a link to DM them. It also works for end-to-end encryption with Reddit, Coinbase, Github, and Hacker News users.
