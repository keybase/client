/* TODO: update examples here
 * Example Fs routes:
 *
 *   Mobile:
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/folder
 *       /keybase folder view
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/folder/folder/folder
 *       /keybase/team/keybase folder view
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/preview
 *       file preview of some file under /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/sendLinkToChat
 *       send a KBFS path link to chat in folder view screen of /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/preview/SendLinkToChat
 *       send a KBFS path link to chat in file previewview screen of some file
 *       under /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/destinationPicker/destinationPicker/destinationPicker
 *       moveOrCopy dialog showing /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:settings/settingsTab:fsTab/destinationPicker
 *       moveOrCopy dialog showing /keybase
 *
 * Note that folder and destinationPicker are siblings on mobile. This is to
 * make sure:
 *   1) foler view keeps all component layers mounted, so user can swipe back;
 *   2) moveOrCopy view keeps all layers mounted too, so user can swipe back to
 *      go to parent folder;
 *   3) we can use switchTo when user taps "Cancel" in the moveOrCopy dialog to
 *      switch back to whatever folder route that user was on before initiating
 *      moveOrCopy;
 *
 *   Desktop:
 *     /tabs:fsTab/folder
 *       /keybase folder view
 *     /tabs:fsTab/folder/folder/folder
 *       /keybase/team/keybase folder view
 *     /tabs:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/preview
 *       file preview of some file under /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/sendLinkToChat
 *       send a KBFS path link to chat in folder view screen of /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/preview/SendLinkToChat
 *       send a KBFS path link to chat in file previewview screen of some file
 *       under /keybase/team/keybase
 *     /tabs:fsTab/folder/folder/folder/destinationPicker
 *       moveOrCopy dialog active when main view is in /keybase/team/keybase;
 *       doesn't matter what folder moveOrCopy dialog is showing
 *
 * Unlike mobile, with desktop destinationPicker is just a subroute of any
 * folder view. This is because:
 *   1) there's no "back" behavior we need to support;
 *   2) we need to go to arbitrary path without introducing another layer.
 * So just make moveOrCopy a single layer of destinationPicker on top of the
 * folder view, and use the redux store to bookkeep the currently showing path
 * in moveOrCopy.
 *
 * Note that in either case, we only store an index in routeProps, and have
 * container look for relevant information (destination's path, as well as
 * moving/copying target's path.
