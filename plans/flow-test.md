# E2E Flow Test Coverage — Page Checklist

**Skill:** Use the `keybase-e2e-tests` skill for testID conventions, Playwright gotchas, Maestro command patterns, and iOS navigation structure.

Each bucket is a logical group for one or more PRs. Items are ordered easiest-first within each bucket. Validate after each bucket before moving on.

**Pairing rule:** Buckets 1–15: do Electron and iOS together. Buckets 16+ (visual-coverage expansion): Electron first; iOS gets a follow-up pass once the desktop suite is stable.

**Branch scripts:** `yarn test:e2e:desktop:branch` and `yarn test:e2e:ios:branch` run only the new flows being developed. When a flow is verified working on both platforms, remove it from the branch scripts. When adding a new bucket's test files, add them to both scripts.

**Goal:** 100% visual coverage of the app. Every test's final screenshot is a visual-regression baseline (playwright `screenshot: 'on'` + `yarn test:e2e:desktop:save-baseline`), and the dark-mode project doubles every shot for free. So coverage = one test per distinct visual state: routes, modals, popups, scroll positions, filled inputs.

**Mutations are now IN SCOPE** when the flow is reproducible:
- **Create → cleanup in the same test.** A test that creates something must delete it before it ends (git repo, channel, email address, paper key). Use fixed `e2e-vis-*` names and delete any leftover at test start so a crashed run self-heals.
- **Open → cancel is always fine.** Any modal/wizard can be opened and screenshotted as long as the test cancels before the final submit when the mutation isn't cleanly reversible.
- **Never touch:** account deletion/reset, revoking a real device (paper keys created by the test are OK), logging out, changing the password, verifying a phone number, creating/revoking real proofs, leaving or deleting real teams, blocking real users. See the Forbidden list at the bottom.
- Avoid visual nondeterminism: created objects use fixed names, message sends go to a dedicated e2e conversation (accept that its history grows — screenshot the input/modal states, not the message list).

**testID rule:** Never wrap existing component content in a new `Kb.Box2` (or any container) just to attach a `testID`. Instead, add the `testID` prop directly to an element that already exists in the component — an input, a scroll view, a pre-existing wrapper, etc.

## Forbidden — never automate

Not reproducible or account-damaging. Do not add tests for these.

- Logging out (`settingsLogOutTab` submit), changing the password (`recoverPasswordSetPassword`, password modal save)
- Revoking any device the test didn't create (paper keys created in Bucket 23 are the only exception)
- Actually creating a team (names are permanent), leaving/deleting real teams, renaming subteams (`teamRename`), kicking members (`teamReallyRemoveMember`, `teamReallyRemoveChannelMember`)
- Blocking/reporting real users (submit side of `chatBlockingModal`), removing bots (`chatConfirmRemoveBot`)
- Verifying a phone number (`settingsVerifyPhone`), posting/revoking real proofs (`profileRevoke`, proof-flow submits), importing PGP keys (`profileImport`)
- Joining teams (`teamJoinTeamDialog`), wallet account removal submit (`reallyRemoveAccount`)
- Files `confirmDelete` on real user data (test-created files OK)
- Login/signup/provision routes — unreachable while logged in
- `incomingShareNew` — OS share sheet only, unreachable
- `chatSendToChat`, `chatLocationPreview` — FS-share / location send paths, mobile/OS-dependent
