Currently we're using ES6/7 extensions through babel
All files and folders should use the naming convention:

```
/this-is-a-folder/a-file.js
```

If you run into weird issues with your packager this may be due to a stale cache. Run this command to wipe your local cache
```
npm run packager-wipe-cache
```
