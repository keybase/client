# The environment file lets run_keybase pass along KEYBASE_START_UI. The
# autostart file will set that to suppress showing the main window during boot.
# %t is the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, and the leading - means it's ok if the file is
# missing.
EnvironmentFile=-%t/keybase/keybase.gui.env

# We don't set Restart=, since a GUI crash is probably visible to the user.

# We don't have an [Install] section, since the app is intended to be started
# from ~/.config/autostart. Running it in e.g. an SSH session is unlikely to be
# correct.
