# This script handles distro-independent Linux post-install tasks. Currently
# that means managing the /keybase redirector mountpoint. The deb-
# and rpm-specific post-install scripts call into this after doing their
# distro-specific work, which is mainly setting up package repos for updates.

# The script also attempts to restart services if the mountpoint is not being used.
# To disable this behavior, create /etc/keybase/config.json if it doesn't exist
# and add the key value pair { "disable-autorestart": true }.
