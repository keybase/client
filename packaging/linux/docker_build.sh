# This script is the starting point for Linux packaging builds. Here's what the
# build does:
#   1) create the "keybase_packaging_v*" docker image, if it doesn't exist
#   2) run the "inside_docker_main.sh" script in that image, sharing several
#      directories from your host, which does all the following...
#   3) build .deb and .rpm packages and lay them out along with the new repo
#      metadata and signatures
#   4) push the packages and repo metadata to our prerelease.keybase.io S3 bucket
#
# This script mostly concerns itself with updating git repos and organizing
# GPG/SSH/S3 keys for the docker container.
