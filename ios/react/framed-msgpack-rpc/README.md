This is a react-native compatible fork of https://github.com/maxtaco/node-framed-msgpack-rpc React's bundler doesn't expect / handle polyfills well yet so when this code does stuff like require('net') or require('util') things break. The simplest thing to do for now is to just fork it and comment things out so we can port changes over. Making the code work well in both places will add a lot of complexity to the code that isn't worth it at th emoment.
