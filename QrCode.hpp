/* 
 * A QR Code symbol, which is a type of two-dimension barcode.
 * Invented by Denso Wave and described in the ISO/IEC 18004 standard.
 * Instances of this class represent an immutable square grid of black and white cells.
 * The class provides static factory functions to create a QR Code from text or binary data.
 * The class covers the QR Code Model 2 specification, supporting all versions (sizes)
 * from 1 to 40, all 4 error correction levels, and 4 character encoding modes.
 * 
 * Ways to create a QR Code object:
 * - High level: Take the payload data and call QrCode::encodeText() or QrCode::encodeBinary().
 * - Mid level: Custom-make the list of segments and call QrCode::encodeSegments().
 * - Low level: Custom-make the array of data codeword bytes (including
 *   segment headers and final padding, excluding error correction codewords),
 *   supply the appropriate version number, and call the QrCode() constructor.
 * (Note that all ways require supplying the desired error correction level.)
